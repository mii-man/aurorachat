<h1>PLEASE USE "LETS CHAT" INSTEAD OF THIS. AURORACHAT IS KIND OF JANKY AND HAS ONLY CONSOLE TEXT</h1>

<h2>Update Log (All versions that have the word "un-released" were never released, and all versions that have the word "indev" meant they are in development)</h2>

v0.0.1 unreleased indev - Full Code Revamp due to me realising that citro2d has better text than the console. Also added a messsage sound from LINE (the texting app) to make the message sound.

v0.0.0 unreleased - I have no idea.
