# Server outages
There are server outages very often, the reason why is because we are constantly under attack by ddosers, thankfully fail2ban and other systems seem to be majorly assisting, but there are points of downtime.


# Security
We are currently working on end-to-end encryption (actually I don't know that you can call it that or not) that will prevent MITM (Man In The Middle) attacks and protect our users.

Current ETA: NONE (On hold)


<h2>Development Log</h2>
<ul>
<li>v0.0.3.9 (unreleased, indev, slowly progressing) - Added awesome encryption and console-specific IDs.</li>
<li>v0.0.3.4 - Security stuff and stack boostage. First release of the PC Client!</li>
<li>v0.0.3.3 - Fixed a crash relating to duplicate theme text.</li>
<li>v0.0.3.2 - Added 3 more themes and fixed up the theme manager</li>
<li>v0.0.3.1 - Added 2 more themes and fixed some issues with the code</li>
<li>v0.0.3 - Added themes.</li>
<li>v0.0.2.5 - Extended name length</li>
<li>v0.0.2.3 and v0.0.2.4 - Added metadata (first incorrectly, then correctly.)</li>
<li>v0.0.2.2 - Fixed an issue with what we think is RAM allocation. Fixed through removing audio.</li>
<li>v0.0.2.1 - Fixed an audio issue on the 3DS client.</li>
<li>v0.0.2 - Full Code Revamp 2 using a securer version of hbchat as a base.</li>
<li>v0.0.1 (unreleased, never fully developed) - Full Code Revamp due to me realising that citro2d has better text than the console. Also added a messsage sound from LINE (the texting app) to make the message sound. (Edit as of 10/22/25 AEDT: I'm using self made sound effects for sending and receiving messages)</li>
<li>v0.0.0 (unreleased) - I have no idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Welcome to the AuroraChat Repository!</h2>
<p>If you want to help me with this project, then sure! You can do that :D</p>
<p>Again, please look at VirtuallyExisting's profile as he inspired me to make this, and he is making a successor to hbchat.</p>

Note (From Virtualle): I have not given up on Let's Chat, I'm just helping mii-man get a good running start with aurorachat, and I'm bored, of course I'm still actively developing Let's Chat because it is my main focus, helping aurorachat is just a side-project for me, but still done regardless.

I feel like aurorachat and Let's Chat's existences are kind of like Juxt and other miiverse clones, they exist, but they help each other out from time to time.

(shortly after, I realized there are no remaining miiverse clones 💀)

Note (from hackertron): I don't really have anything better to do, but I help out virtualle with his projects so I will also be here assisting. This doesn't mean I'm working on aurorachat because I "have" to, basically copy and paste Virtualle's note except I don't develop Let's Chat
