<h1>aurorachat</h1>
A chatting application for the Nintendo 3DS and 2DS line of systems

<h2>Update Log (All versions that have the word "un-released" were never released, and all versions that have the word "indev" mean they are in development)</h2>
<ul>
<li>v0.0.2 - Full Code Revamp 2 using a securer version of hbchat as a base. Not on GitHub Releases but is on the repo.</li>
<li>v0.0.1 (unreleased, never fully developed) - Full Code Revamp due to me realising that citro2d has better text than the console. Also added a messsage sound from LINE (the texting app) to make the message sound. (Edit as of 10/22/25 AEDT: I'm using self made sound effects for sending and receiving messages)</li>
<li>v0.0.0 (unreleased) - I have no idea.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Welcome to the AuroraChat Repository!</h2>
<p>If you want to help me with this project, then sure! You can do that :D</p>
<p>Again, please look at VirtuallyExisting's profile as he inspired me to make this, and he is making a successor to hbchat.</p>

Note (From Virtualle): I have not given up on Let's Chat, I'm just helping mii-man get a good running start with aurorachat, and I'm bored, of course I'm still actively developing Let's Chat because it is my main focus, helping aurorachat is just a side-project for me, but still done regardless.

I feel like aurorachat and Let's Chat existences are kind of like Juxt and other miiverse clones, they exist, but they help each other out from time to time.
